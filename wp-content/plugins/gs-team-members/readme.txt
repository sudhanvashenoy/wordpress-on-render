Duplicating a shortcode is easy. You can duplicate any existing or newly created shortcode, including its saved settings.

Deleting a shortcode is straightforward, but be cautious before hitting the delete button, as it will permanently remove the shortcode.

= How to Overwrite Templates? =

All templates are available inside **gs-team-members/templates**

To override templates, create a folder named ***gs-team*** in your current themes folder, and you can override the files from the templates of the plugin.

For example, to overwrite a single template copy ***gs-team-single-default.php*** from **/gs-team-members/templates/singles/gs-team-single-default.php** to **/yourtheme/gs-team/singles/gs-team-single.php** and make the required changes. You'll see the changes in the front end. 

By doing this, you can customize the plugin's templates without modifying its core code, preventing the changes from being overwritten during future updates.

The default path for template override is: **gs-team**
Copy any file from the plugin **templates** folder to **/themes/theme-name/gs-team** folder and override them accordingly.

However, if the user wants to set up his folder something like this: ***themes/theme-name/templates/gs-team***
This is also possible, just need to add a filter in this theme to change the default path.

Here's it:
`
add_filter( 'gsteam_templates_folder', function() {
  return 'templates/gs-team';
});
`

The partial templates can be found in **gs-team-members/templates/partials**. You can similarly override these templates by copying them to **yourtheme/gs-team/partials**.

By referring to the [Template Override Documentation](https://docs.gsplugins.com/gs-team-members/template-override), you can easily customize Team Members templates to suit your project’s needs.

[Check Query Settings for Alphabetical Order](https://docs.gsplugins.com/gs-team-members/faq/#how-to-display-team-members-in-alphabetical-order).

= How to display Team Members in Custom Order? =

Custom Sort Order involves two main steps:

- Step 1: Rearrange Members by Drag & Drop
- Step 2: Configure Query Settings for Members

Please refer to the detailed documentation on [Custom Sort Order](https://docs.gsplugins.com/gs-team-members/manage-gs-team-member/sort-order/), which includes screenshots for better understanding.

= How to display Team Members in ASC/DESC order? =

By default, the most recently added members will be displayed at the top of the screen in the Team Members section. Members are ordered in descending order, meaning the newest additions are shown first. However, if you prefer to display members in ascending order, you can adjust this setting using the Query Settings feature.

To arrange members in Ascending Order, follow these steps:

- Go to GS Team
- Team Shortcode
- Crete/Edit Shortcode
- Go to Query Settings (3rd tab)
- Set Order > ASC (From Dropdown)
- Save the Shortcode.

= How to display Team Members as per their ID? =

To display Team Members according to their unique IDs, follow these steps:

When you add a new Team Member and publish it in WordPress, the platform automatically assigns an ID to each member. For example, ***1893*** represents Hugh Jakman in this instance. Other team members have similar IDs: 1894 (Haley), 1895 (Richard), 1896 (Garza), and 1897 (Solaytic).

To arrange members based on their IDs, follow these steps:

- Set the Query Settings to **Order: DESC** and **Order By: Team ID**.
- With this configuration, the last published members will be displayed first, sorted according to their IDs. For instance:
	- 1897 (Solaytic)
	- 1896 (Garza)
	- 1895 (Richard)
	- 1894 (Haley)
	- 1893 (Hugh Jakman)

[Check Query Settings for the Members by Team ID](https://docs.gsplugins.com/gs-team-members/faq/#how-to-display-team-members-as-per-their-id).

= How to display Team Member profiles as per the published date? =

To Display Members as per Published Date, follow these steps:

- Go to GS Team
- Team Shortcode
- Crete/Edit Shortcode
- Go to Query Settings (3rd tab)
- Set **Order By: Date** (From Dropdown)
- Set **Order: DESC** (From Dropdown). ASC/DESC may be set to your liking.
- Save the Shortcode.

= How to display Team Members randomly? =
To Display Members randomly, follow these steps:

- Go to GS Team
- Team Shortcode
- Crete/Edit Shortcode
- Go to Query Settings (3rd tab)
- Set **Order By: Random** (From Dropdown)
- Set **Order: DESC** (From Dropdown). ASC/DESC may be set to your liking.
- Save the Shortcode.

= How can I reorder Groups/Categories in the Team Members plugin? =

If you need to rearrange or reorder your groups/categories within the Team Members plugin, the process is straightforward and mirrors the steps for reordering members.

Customizing the order of Groups/Categories involves two primary steps:

- Step 1: Drag & Drop to rearrange Groups
- Step 2: Query Settings for Groups

Please refer to the detailed documentation on [Reordering Groups/Categories](https://docs.gsplugins.com/gs-team-members/manage-gs-team-member/sort-order/#reordering-groups-categories), which includes screenshots for better understanding.

= How to Display Team Members from Specific or Multiple Categories? =

To display Team Members from specific or multiple categories, follow these steps:

- Go to GS Team
- Team Shortcode
- Crete/Edit Shortcode
- Go to Query Settings (3rd tab)
- Set Order: DESC (From Dropdown). ASC/DESC may be set to your liking.

- Specialty
- Gender
