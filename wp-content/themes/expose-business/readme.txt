==== CSS ====

This theme includes both readable and minified CSS files.
Since you have requested a version of the theme without build tools,
you will need to use another method to minify the files.

To add additional block styles:
1) Create a new CSS file inside the assets/css/blocks folder.
Use the slug of the block as the file name.
2) Next, open functions.php and add the slug to the $styled_blocks array inside the setup function.
